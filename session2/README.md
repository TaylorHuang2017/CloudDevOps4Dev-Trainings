## Session 2: Deploying and Scaling Micro services with Docker and Kubernetes on Azure

Focus on the new Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), dive into the details of build, ship and run a Microservices architecture application using Visual Studio, VSTS and AKS. Starting from coding in a Docker for Windows enabled VM as the development workstation backed by DevTest Lab, then we will commit the code into a VSTS git repo and build up the release pipeline to deliver into a AKS cluster environment. Finally, we will run a rolling update triggered by VSTS release pipeline on AKS to show the capabilities of container based cluster.

Key take-away:

- Understanding of capabilities of containers, docker and Kubernetes and how to take advantage of these technologies in daily work
- In depth knowledge of Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) and how to manage such service in Microsoft Azure

**Hands-on Lab Instructions**

### Lab 01. Create a Azure DevTestLabs VM & Install Docker for Windows

In Azure Portal, click on **All Services | Search for Dev **

![](images/devtestlabs-01.png)

Click on **Add**, give it a name and enable **Auto Shutdown**, recommended region for Chinese Developers is **Southeast Asia (Singapore)** because there are more VM SKUs then the East Asia (Hongkong), we need **Dv3 or Ev3** for running **Nested Virutalization** on the VM to install **Docker for Windows** later.

**Auto Shutdown** will help to save your Azure Credit because you don't really need this machine to be running when you are sleeping.

![](images/devtestlabs-02.png)

Wait about 3 mins you will see the Dashboard for your Lab. In My Labs section, there are many useful feature to support a Dev Team

- **My virtual machines**: shows machines owned by yourself.
- **Claimable virtual machines**: you can create a couple of SDE (Standard Development Environment) machines for your team according to the SDKs and projects and place them here for team member to share.
- **My data disks**: for you to create shared disks that can be attached to different machines so you don't worry about move your data around. 
- **Formulas**: some scripts for you to install sofewares on these machines automatically
- **My secrets**: save database username, connection string, production password etc. here so you don't have to remember them.

![](images/devtestlabs-03.png)

Click on Add button and search for Visual Studio 2017, choose Visual Studio 2017 Enterprise on Windows 10 (latest release), and use E2S_v3 (2core, 16G Ram) SKU.

We need Ev3 for **Nested Virtualization** support.

Wait until the VM is running and get the RDP file from Connect option

![](images/devtestlabs-05.png)

Enable Hyper-V and Containers support on the VM

![](images/devtestlabs-06.png)

Install the following Softwares

- Visual Studio Code (stable channel) https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Git for Windows https://git-scm.com/
- Azure CLI 2.0 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest 
- Docker for Windows (CE stable channel) https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows
- Cmder (Full Installer) http://cmder.net

### Lab 02. Config & Test your Docker for Windows Development Machine

**Switch between Linux & Windows Containers**

Docker for Windows supports both Linux and Windows Containers, you can choose which one to use from he context menu.

Note: make sure you are clear which one to use when you are working on your application.

![](images/devtestlabs-07.png)

![](images/devtestlabs-08.png)

**Enable Shared Drives to use Docker Volume**

Make sure your tick all the dirves in Shared Drives configuration, this allows you to map a folder from your computer inside Docker Containers which is very useful when you are debugging your application.

![](images/devtestlabs-09.png)

**Increase the memory usage for Docker Containers VM**

As we have 16G Ram for the VM, it's ok for allocate more memory for the Docker Container VM. This will allow you to run your application faster.

Note: Docker for Windows in Linux mode will use a MobyLinux VM running in Hyper-V to host a linux VM.

![](images/devtestlabs-10.png)

**Run your first Docker Containers**

Linux Containers

Switch to Linux Containers and run the following command (using Cmder).

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

If you see something like this, your Docker for Windows (Linux Cotnainer mode) is working correctly.

![](images/devtestlabs-11.png)

Windows Containers

Switch to Windows Containers and run the following command (using Cmder).

```Powershell
docker run -it microsoft/nanoserver cmd
```

![](images/devtestlabs-12.png)

This will pull a container image microsoft/nanoserver and run cmd inside it, then you can run the following command inside the Windows Container.

```PowerShell
powershell.exe Add-Content C:\HelloWorld.ps1 'Write-Host "Hello World from Windows Container"'
exit
```

![](images/devtestlabs-13.png)

Basically, we have create a HelloWorld.ps1 script inside this nanoserver container, now let's save this container as our own HelloWorld container image.

```bash
docker ps -a
```

This command will list all running and stopped container, you need to write down the {container id} and put into the next command

```bash
docker commit {continer id} helloworld
```

Basiclly, we have created a new Docker Container Image with our HelloWorld.ps1 in there.

![](images/devtestlabs-14.png)

Now, we can run our Windows Hello World Container.

```bash
docker run helloworld poweshell.exe c:\HelloWorld.ps1
```

![](images/devtestlabs-15.png)

Now, our Azure DevTestLabs VM is ready for containerized application development.

### Lab 03 - Code, Build, Debug & Test Docker Containers on Azure DevTestLabs VMs

Note: The following steps are using Linux Containers.

**Debug a Asp.Net Core WebApp in Visual Studio and Docker for Windows**

Create a new **ASP.NET Core Web Application** in VS 2017, name the application **aspnet-core-docker-linux**
![](images/debugging-core-01.png)

Choose **Web Application (MVC)** and Enable **Docker Support with OS = Linux**
![](images/debugging-core-02.png)

Visual Studio will start pulling down base image for .net core 2.0, wait until the Output window says "Done! Docker containers are ready"
![](images/debugging-core-03.png)

Open a cmder windows and check the images

```bash
docker images
```

![](images/debugging-core-04.png)

Press F5 to start debugging on the application, set a breakpoint in HomeController line 20 and trigger the breakpoint, you can see VS break into that line of code and you can debug the application line by line.

![](images/debugging-core-05.png)

Open a cmder window and build the image manually, make sure your at the root of the solution folder

```bash
Î» docker build -f aspnet-core-docker-linux\Dockerfile -t aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1 .

```

Now, we can check the images again.

```bash
C:\Users\leixu\source\repos\aspnet-core-docker-linux
Î» docker images

```

You can see there is aspnetcore-dockerlinux with TAG:v1 available for use. Run the following command to start this container on port 8080 and 80801

```bash
C:\Users\leixu\source\repos\aspnet-core-docker-linux
Î» docker run -itd -p 8080:80 aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1
b1befafcd580f225ae37888bff644d346f2035723862875d38c20675824fb59d

C:\Users\leixu\source\repos\aspnet-core-docker-linux
Î» docker run -itd -p 8081:80 aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1
99a4cee77ea7c5a173e0eb38c1935142d8309af90c009e860f46025b34e9ebe3
```

Open browser for both of the address, you can see we have 2 instances of the same application running on different port

- http://localhost:8080
- http://localhost:8001

![](images/debugging-core-06.png)

You can modify the application and run docker build again to build a v2; then run v2 on port 8082.

```bash
docker build -f aspnet-core-docker-linux\Dockerfile -t aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v2 .
docker run -itd 8082:80 aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v2
```
Now, we have 3 instances of 2 version of the application running on the same machine on 3 different ports.
![](images/debugging-core-07.png)

**Run a multi-container micro-services application**

Get the sample from Github

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lean-soft/voting-azure-devops.git
cd voting-azure-devops
code .
docker-compose up
```

Note: command **code .** will open the application folder in Visual Studo Code for later debugging.

Wait a while until you see the cmder window starting showing logs from the containers (with db, result_1, worker_1 as prefix), then your application is up and running, you can open a browser to open the following address:

- Voting Page http://localhost:5000
- Result Page http://localhost:5001

Note: The first time running linux container on a Windows Machine will trigger a confirmation from Windows Firewall, just click **Allow access**.
![](images/debugging-01.png)

You can see the voting and result pages are showing up and linux containers are running inside the cmder window.
![](images/debugging-02.png)

Refer to the architecture of this applicatiob below to understand how easy it is to use docker to run a multiple container micro services system on a single machine, which is impossible without docker.
![](images/debugging-03.png)

TIP: use the following command to quickly clean up your running and stopped containers. It's very easy to leave a lot of containers running so it's good idea to clean them up from time to time. 

```bash
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -a -q') DO docker stop %i
FOR /f "tokens=*" %i IN ('docker ps -a -q') DO docker rm %i
```

### Lab 04 - Setting up Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Container Registry is used to manage docker images as artifact store, as docker containers are tagged with version, container registry will become the version control for images.

Create ACR

```bash
## Login from command line
az login

## Set the default subscription
az account set --subscription "{subscription id}"

## Create resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

## Create ACR
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name <acrName> --sku Basic
```

Get ACR username and password and docker login into it

```bash
## Get ACR username and password and write it down
az acr update --name <acrName> --admin-enabled true

## Use username and password from above to login
docker login <acrname>.azurecr.io
Login Succeed
```

Tag the images we have created above and push into the ACR

```bash
docker tag aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1 <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1
docker tag aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v2 <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v2

docker push <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v1
docker push <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/aspnetcore-dockerlinux:v2
```

Now you can check the images on Azure Portal, goto **Resource Group | myResouceGroup | {acrName} | Repositories**, you can see v1 and v2 are there

![](images/acr-01.png)

Do the following and publish container images for voting-azure-devops repo

```bash
cd voting-azure-devops
docker-compose build

docker tag votingazuredevops_vote <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/vote
docker tag votingazuredevops_result <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/result
docker tag votingazuredevops_worker <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/worker

docker push <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/vote
docker push <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/result
docker push <acrname>.azurecr.io/linux/worker
```

Check **Resource Group | myResouceGroup | {acrName} | Repositories** again.

![](images/acr-02.png)

Now, we have our images ready for deploy into AKS.
